The solution class.

Main method declaration with "throw Exception"
Create a BufferedReader named "br" that takes the InputStreamReader data from System.in
Create a PrintWriter named "pw" that outputs to System.out
Create a StringTokenizer named "st" that pulls from "br" with br.readLine().
Create integer N and pipe in integers with Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken)
Create integer t and pipe in integers with Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken)
Create array r with N's data.
create st = newStringTokenizer with br.readLine
for loop that iterates through r array and fills it with array
using parseInt(st.nextToken
)
while loop that starts t -- > 0
creates a st variable that is set to StringTokenizer(br.readLine)
create integer i that is set to Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken)
create integer j that is set to Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken)
create integer mini set to 3
for loop that starts at i and is less than j
set mini = to Math.min(mini, r[k]); this takes the array r and compares it to mini of 3
}
print the product of mini which has been compared to the array to determine the minimum size
}
pw.flush() to output the result.
}
}
